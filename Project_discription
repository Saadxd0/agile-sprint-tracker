üìå Project Title:
Agile Team Sprint Tracker with GitHub Integration (Multi-Sprint Support)
________________________________________
üéØ Objective:
Build a Java-based system that allows Agile teams to manage multiple sprints, track user stories, assign tasks to team members, and automatically fetch updates/issues from GitHub repositories to maintain sprint visibility.
________________________________________
üß© Key Features:
‚Ä¢	Create and manage multiple Agile sprints.
‚Ä¢	Add, edit, and remove user stories and tasks per sprint.
‚Ä¢	Assign tasks to team members.
‚Ä¢	Track progress and status of tasks (To Do, In Progress, Done).
‚Ä¢	Integrate with GitHub Issues API to pull live GitHub issues into a sprint.
‚Ä¢	Visual display (CLI or basic GUI) of sprint overview and progress.

üèóÔ∏è Project Structure ‚Äî File & Class Guide:
Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what files/classes to create and their responsibility **(no code, just descriptions):
________________________________________
1. Main.java
Purpose:
Acts as the entry point of the application. Initializes the UI/CLI and connects major components together.
________________________________________
2. Sprint.java
Purpose:
Represents a single sprint. Holds:
‚Ä¢	Sprint name
‚Ä¢	Start and end dates
‚Ä¢	List of user stories
________________________________________
3. UserStory.java
Purpose:
Represents an Agile user story. Includes:
‚Ä¢	Title
‚Ä¢	Description
‚Ä¢	List of tasks
‚Ä¢	Priority level
‚Ä¢	Story points
________________________________________
4. Task.java
Purpose:
Represents a task within a user story. Includes:
‚Ä¢	Task title
‚Ä¢	Assigned team member
‚Ä¢	Status (To Do, In Progress, Done)
________________________________________
5. TeamMember.java
Purpose:
Stores team member details:
‚Ä¢	Name
‚Ä¢	Email or GitHub username
‚Ä¢	Assigned tasks
________________________________________
6. SprintManager.java
Purpose:
Controls the creation, deletion, and management of multiple sprints.
Handles switching between sprints and updating their data.
________________________________________
7. GitHubIntegration.java
Purpose:
Handles connection to the GitHub Issues API.
Fetches issues from a GitHub repository and converts them into tasks or user stories.
________________________________________
8. DataStorage.java
Purpose:
Responsible for saving and loading project data (sprints, stories, tasks) to a local file or JSON format for persistence.
________________________________________
9. UIManager.java
Purpose:
Manages user interface (console-based or GUI).
Presents menus, handles inputs, and displays sprint dashboards and updates.
________________________________________
üîß Technologies to Use:
‚Ä¢	Java (Core, OOP principles)
‚Ä¢	REST API (for GitHub integration)
‚Ä¢	JSON (for data storage)
‚Ä¢	Optional: Swing or JavaFX (if GUI is needed)
________________________________________
üîÅ Flow of Application:
1.	User runs the app via Main.java.
2.	SprintManager loads existing sprints (if any) using DataStorage.
3.	User can create a new sprint or manage existing ones.
4.	Within a sprint, the user can:
o	Add user stories
o	Create and assign tasks
o	Fetch GitHub issues (via GitHubIntegration)
5.	Tasks get assigned and tracked by status.
6.	Progress and reports can be shown via UIManager.
________________________________________
‚úÖ Expected Outcome:
A fully functional Agile Sprint Tracker that helps a team organize sprints and tasks, and integrate issues from GitHub for real-time synchronization.
